cppfastdevelop
==============

A simple but powerful c++ project called "cppfastdevelop" which makes your develop fast.


We provide:

1.A simple c++ foundation classes-tree named "cppfoundation" which includes many classes frequently used.

For example, synchronization(between threads and processes) , IPC , socket (tcp,unix-domain,udp)... These classes is the foundation system-invoke wrapping,they DONOT include any framework or library. They're very helpful to make your own library or framework.
2.A library repertory named "cpplibrary" which include many libraries c++ developer frequently used.

For example, we'll supply simple log library, net frameworks, simple memory pool, simple message queue, database access library, crypto library and base data-structure. We will add other useful libraries if we need it.

Attention:
1.We'll never try to replace boost,poco or any other c++ library.

The "cppfastdevelop" project only helps you to develop more easily when using cplusplus and other libraries are complementary to the "cppfastdevelop" project. It gives you some choices to select libraries using in your project. You may use "cppfoundation" as the main foundation class
2.We will support linux and bsd( maybe also windows, mac os x and ibm aix if we have enough time to do that ).

3.We hope you to join us to make the project more perfect.
