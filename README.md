cppfastdevelop
==============

A simple but powerful c++ project called "cppfastdevelop" ("cfd") which makes your develop fast. The "cfd" project include "cppfoundation" ("cf") and "cpplibrary" ("cl") projects.

WE PROVIDE:

1.A simple c++ classes-tree named "cf" which includes many classes frequently used.
  For example, synchronization(between threads and between processes) , IPC , socket (tcp,unix-domain,udp)... These classes is the system-call wrapping,they DONOT include any framework or library. They're very helpful to  develop your own library or framework.

2.A library repertory named "cl" which include many libraries c++ developer frequently used.
  For example, we'll provide net library,circularqueue,logserver,simple log library,config,simple message queue, database access library,simple memory pool, crypto library and etc. We'll add other useful libraries later.


ATTENTION:

1.We'll never try to replace boost,poco,tbbase(tbnet) or any other c++ library.
  The "cfd" project only helps you to develop more easily when using cplusplus and other libraries are complementary to the "cfd" project. It gives you some choices to choose libraries . You may use "cf" as the main foundation classes.
  
2."cfd" will be compatible with linux and bsd ( maybe also mac os x ,ibm aix and windows , if we have enough time to do that ).

3.We hope you to join us to make the project more perfect.
